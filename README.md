# HW2-Debugging

## Overview
This homework assignment focuses on improving the `merge_sort` implementation, applying static analysis tools, and writing test cases to ensure the code functions correctly. The tasks include debugging, checking code style, and setting up automated testing using pytest.

## Objectives
- Fix the faulty implementation of `merge_sort` in `hw2_debugging.py`.
- Apply static analysis tools to improve code quality.
- Write test cases to verify the functionality of the `merge_sort` algorithm.
- Configure continuous integration to run tests and analysis tools automatically.
